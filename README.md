This repository has been created to store files and notes of our team project related to the university course "Deep Learning a gyakorlatban Python és LUA alapon (BMEVITMAV45)".

## Team name: 	Ch1cken_run

## Members of the team:

Galacz Barnabás (neptun: D133RO)
Szabó Zoltán (neptun: BWLQ1Y)
Simon Zalán (neptun: IOL89K)

## Selected topic:
Identification of defective products with a convolutional autoencoder


## Milestone 2.:

There is only one file related to Milestone 2.: 'VItmav45_Nagyhazi_2_milestone.ipynb', which includes an 'Open in Colab' button.
The code should be run until the code snippet labeled as 'Fitting the model' to complete the learning phase.
Everything after that is evaluation, and an attempt to locate anomalies, which function will be further refined in the finished project.


## Final versions:
